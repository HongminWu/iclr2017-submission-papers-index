The visual servoing problem comes up in robotic tasks that range from target following for an aerial vehicle to robotic manipulation to spacecraft docking. Standard visual servoing approaches typically rely on manually designed features and analytical dynamics models, which limits their generalization capability and often requires extensive feature and model engineering. In this work, we study how learned visual features, learned predictive dynamics models, and reinforcement learning can be combined to learn visual servoing mechanisms. We focus on target following, with the goal of designing algorithms that can learn a visual servo using low amounts of data of the target in question, so as to be easy and quick to adapt to new targets. Our approach is based on servoing the camera in the space of learned visual features, rather than image pixels or manually-designed keypoints. We demonstrate that standard deep features, in our case taken from a model trained for object classification, can be used together with a bilinear predictive model to learn an effective visual servo that is robust to visual variation, changes in viewing angle and appearance, and occlusions. A key component of our approach is to use reinforcement learning to learn which features are best suited for the task at hand. We show that our method can learn an effective visual servo using just tens of trajectories. We evaluate our method on a complex synthetic car following benchmark, and demonstrate substantial improvement over a conventional pixel-based approach.","pdf":"/pdf/83166c402023b52a9b4af867af4af7847352d1d1.pdf","TL;DR":"We use deep semantic features, learned predictive dynamics, and reinforcement learning to efficiently learn a visual servoing policy that is robust to visual variations.","conflicts":["berkeley.edu","google.com","openai.com"],"authors":["Alex X.

By offloading the computational burden of CPU and saving the need for transferring raw data in its entirety, NDP exhibits a great potential for acceleration and power reduction. Despite this potential, specific research activities on NDP have witnessed only limited success until recently, often owing to performance mismatches between logic and memory process technologies that put a limit on the processing capability of memory. Recently, there have been two major changes in the game, igniting the resurgence of NDP with renewed interest. The first is the success of machine learning (ML), which often demands a great deal of computation for training, requiring frequent transfers of big data. The second is the advent of NAND flash-based solid-state drives (SSDs) containing multicore processors that can accommodate extra computation for data processing. Sparked by these application needs and technological support, we evaluate the potential of NDP for ML using a new SSD platform that allows us to simulate in-storage processing (ISP) of ML workloads. Our platform (named ISP-ML) is a full-fledged simulator of a realistic multi-channel SSD that can execute various ML algorithms using the data stored in the SSD. For thorough performance analysis and in-depth comparison with alternatives, we focus on a specific algorithm: stochastic gradient decent (SGD), which is the de facto standard for training differentiable learning machines including deep neural networks. We implement and compare three variants of SGD (synchronous, Downpour, and elastic averaging) using ISP-ML, exploiting the multiple NAND channels for parallelizing SGD. In addition, we compare the performance of ISP and that of conventional in-host processing, revealing the advantages of ISP. Based on the advantages and limitations identified through our experiments, we further discuss directions for future research on ISP for accelerating ML.","pdf":"/pdf/f8b0436ea7370779edd703b7d7d35a9e34752fa9.pdf","keywords":[],"conflicts":["snu.ac.kr","yonsei.ac.kr"],"authors":["Hyeokjun Choe","Seil Lee","Hyunha Nam","Seongsik Park","Seijoon Kim","Eui-Young Chung","Sungroh Yoon"],"authorids":["genesis1104@snu.ac.kr","lees231@dsl.snu.ac.kr","godqhr825@snu.ac.kr","pss015@snu.ac.kr","hokiespa@snu.ac.kr","eychung@yonsei.ac.kr","sryoon@snu.ac.kr"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false},{"tddate":null,"replyto":null,"tcdate":1478379139467,"number":601,"tmdate":1478379139467,"id":"B1oK8aoxe","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/submission","forum":"B1oK8aoxe","signatures":["~Carlos_Florensa1"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["~Carlos_Florensa1"],"content":{"title":"Stochastic Neural Networks for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning","abstract":"Deep reinforcement learning has achieved many impressive results in recent years. However, many of the deep RL algorithms still employ naive exploration strategies, and they have been shown to perform poorly in tasks with sparse rewards, and/or with long horizons. To tackle these challenges, there are two common approaches. The first approach is to design a hierarchy over the actions, which would require domain-specific knowledge and careful hand-engineering. A different line of work utilizes domain-agnostic intrinsic rewards to guide exploration, which has been shown to be effective in tasks with sparse rewards. However, it is unclear how the knowledge of solving a task can be utilized for other tasks, leading to a high sample complexity overall for the entire collection of tasks. In this paper, we propose a general framework for learning useful skills in a pre-training environment, which can then be utilized in downstream tasks by training a high-level policy over these skills. To learn these skills, we use stochastic neural networks (SNNs) combined with an intrinsic reward, the design of which requires very minimal domain knowledge about the downstream tasks. Our experiments show that this combination is effective in learning a wide span of interpretable skills in a sample-efficient way, and, when trained on downstream tasks, can significantly boost the learning performance uniformly across all these tasks.

Although SGD scales well in terms of both the size of dataset and the number of parameters of the model, it has rapidly diminishing returns as parallel computing resources increase.  Second-order optimization methods have an affinity for well-estimated gradients and large mini-batches, and can therefore benefit much more from parallel computation in principle.   Unfortunately,  they often employ severe approximations to the curvature matrix in order to scale to large models with millions of parameters, limiting their effectiveness in practice versus well-tuned SGD with momentum.  The recently proposed K-FAC method(Martens and Grosse, 2015) uses a stronger and more sophisticated curvature approximation, and has been shown to make much more per-iteration progress than SGD, while only introducing a modest overhead.  In this paper, we develop a version of K-FAC that distributes the computation of gradients and additional quantities required by K-FAC across multiple machines, thereby taking advantage of method’s superior scaling to large mini-batches and mitigating its additional overheads. We provide a Tensorflow implementation of our approach which is easy to use and can be applied to many existing codebases without modification.  Additionally, we develop several algorithmic enhancements to K-FAC which can improve its computational performance for very large models.

Recent efforts towards reducing these overheads involve pruning and compressing the weights of various layers without hurting the accuracy. However, using weights pruning to generate sparse CNNs mostly reduces parameters from the fully connected layers and may not significantly reduce the computation costs with irregular sparsity. We present an acceleration method for CNNs, where we prune filters from CNNs that are identified as having a small effect on the output accuracy.  By removing whole filters in the network, together with their connecting feature maps, the computational costs are reduced significantly. In contrast to weights pruning, this approach does not result in sparse connectivity patterns.

Further, for species not in the ImageNet categories that are visually similar to some category, the cosine similarity of their activation vectors in the same layer should be high.

In this paper, we examine how reinforcement learning algorithms can transfer knowledge between morphologically different agents (e.g., different robots). We introduce a problem formulation where twp agents are tasked with learning multiple skills by sharing information.

The training of VGAN takes a two step procedure: given $p(\\mathbf{x})$, $q(\\mathbf{x})$ is updated to maximize the lower bound; $p(\\mathbf{x})$ is then updated one step with samples drawn from $q(\\mathbf{x})$ to decrease the lower bound. VGAN is inspired by the generative adversarial networks (GANs), where $p(\\mathbf{x})$ corresponds to the discriminator and $q(\\mathbf{x})$ corresponds to the generator, but with several notable differences.

The re-training process effectively performs distance metric learning under the object persistency constraints, to modify the view-manifold of object representations. It reduces the effective distance between the representations of different views of the same object without compromising the distance between those of the views of different objects, resulting in the untangling of the view-manifolds between individual objects within the same category and across categories. This untangling enables the model to discriminate and recognize objects within the same category, independent of viewpoints. We found that this ability is not limited to the trained objects, but transfers to novel objects in both trained and untrained categories, as well as to a variety of completely novel artificial synthetic objects. This transfer in learning suggests the modification of distance metrics in view- manifolds is more general and abstract, likely at the levels of parts, and independent of the specific objects or categories experienced during training.

The current methods, however, have the following two problems: (1) They can not understand the ambiguous use of words in the questions as word usage can strongly depend on the context (e.g. the word “relationship” has quite different meanings in the categories of Love advice and other categories). As a result, the accuracies of their answer selections are not good enough. (2) The current methods can only select from among the answers held by QA sites and can not generate new ones. Thus, they can not answer the questions that are somewhat different with those stored in QA sites. Our solution, Neural Answer Construction Model, tackles these problems as it: (1) Incorporates the biases of semantics behind questions (e.g. categories assigned to questions) into word embeddings while also computing them regardless of the semantics. As a result, it can extract answers that suit the contexts of words used in the question as well as following the common usage of words across semantics. This improves the accuracy of answer selection. (2) Uses biLSTM to compute the embeddings of questions as well as those of the sentences often used to form answers (e.g. sentences representing conclusions or those supplementing the conclusions). It then simultaneously learns the optimum combination of those sentences as well as the closeness between the question and those sentences. As a result, our model can construct an answer that corresponds to the situation that underlies the question; it fills the gap between answer selection and generation and is the first model to move beyond the current simple answer selection model for non-factoid QAs. Evaluations using datasets created for love advice stored in the Japanese QA site, Oshiete goo, indicate that our model achieves 20 % higher accuracy in answer creation than the strong baselines. Our model is practical and has already been applied to the love advice service in Oshiete goo.","pdf":"/pdf/6fca07488d7a8178e3d648d63c7afe084321f9c8.pdf","conflicts":["lab.ntt.co.jp"],"keywords":[],"authors":["Makoto Nakatsuji","Hisashi Ito","Naruhiro Ikeda","Shota Sahara","Akihisa Fujita"],"authorids":["nakatuji@nttr.co.jp","h-ito@nttr.co.jp","nikeda@nttr.co.jp","s-sagara@nttr.co.jp","akihisa@nttr.co.jp"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false},{"tddate":null,"replyto":null,"tcdate":1478354993516,"number":557,"tmdate":1478354993516,"id":"HyY4Owjll","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/submission","forum":"HyY4Owjll","signatures":["~Aditya_Grover1"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["~Aditya_Grover1"],"content":{"TL;DR":"","title":"Boosted Generative Models","abstract":"We propose a new approach for using boosting to create an ensemble of generative models, where models are trained in sequence to correct earlier mistakes.

This work presents new training and decoding methods that improve the quality, coherence, and diversity of long responses generated using sequence-to-sequence models. Our approach adds self-attention to the decoder to maintain coherence in longer responses, and we propose a practical approach, called the glimpse-model, for scaling to large datasets.

We trained on a combined data set of over 2.3B conversation messages mined from the web.

TreNet leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract salient features from local raw data of time series. Meanwhile, considering long-range dependencies existing in the sequence of historical local trends, TreNet uses a long-short term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM) to capture such dependency.

Imitation learning in RL works well whenever the demonstrations are given in the first person: the agent is provided with a sequence of states and a specification of the actions that it should have taken. While powerful, this kind of imitation learning is limited by the relatively hard problem of collecting first person demonstrations.\nHumans address this problem by learning from third person demonstrations: they observe other humans perform tasks, infer the task, and accomplish the same task themselves.\nIn this paper, we present a method for unsupervised third person imitation learn- ing. By using ideas from domain confusion, we are able to train an agent to correctly achieve a simple goal in a simple environment when it is provided a demonstration of a teacher achieving the same goal but from a different view- point. Crucially, the agent receives only these demonstrations, and is not provided a correspondence between teacher states and student states.","pdf":"/pdf/64e9ce78841069414ee147f5a028cbc01a9172dd.pdf","keywords":[],"conflicts":["openai.com","berkeley.edu","cs.berkeley.edu"],"authors":["Bradly C Stadie","Pieter Abbeel","Ilya Sutskever"],"authorids":["bstadie@openai.com","pieter@openai.com","ilyasu@openai.com"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false},{"tddate":null,"replyto":null,"tcdate":1478300105266,"number":530,"tmdate":1478300105266,"id":"SJZAb5cel","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/submission","forum":"SJZAb5cel","signatures":["~Kazuma_Hashimoto1"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["~Kazuma_Hashimoto1"],"content":{"title":"A Joint Many-Task Model: Growing a Neural Network for Multiple NLP Tasks","abstract":"Transfer and multi-task learning have traditionally focused on either a single source-target pair or very few, similar tasks.

The latter requires a memory efficient implementation, as a naive implementation of the Neural GPU is memory intensive.  We find that these techniques increase the set of algorithmic problems that can be solved by the Neural GPU: we have been able to learn to perform all the arithmetic operations (and generalize to arbitrarily long numbers) when the arguments are given in the decimal representation (which, surprisingly, has not been possible before).

Existing works solve this problem by reducing model size using weight approximation methods based on dimension reduction (i.e., SVD, Tucker decomposition and Quantization). However, the execution speed of these compressed models are still far below the real-time processing requirement of mobile services. To address this limitation, we propose a novel acceleration framework: DeepRebirth by exploring the deep learning model parameter sparsity through merging the parameter-free layers with their neighbor convolution layers to a single dense layer. The design of DeepRebirth is motivated by the key observation: some layers (i.e., normalization and pooling) in deep learning models actually consume a large portion of computational time even few learned parameters are involved, and acceleration of these layers has the potential to improve the processing speed significantly. Essentially, the functionality of several merged layers is replaced by the new dense layer – rebirth layer in DeepRebirth. In order to preserve the same functionality, the rebirth layer model parameters are re-trained to be functionality equivalent to the original several merged layers. The extensive experiments performed on ImageNet using several popular mobile devices demonstrate that DeepRebirth is not only providing huge speed-up in model deployment and significant memory saving but also maintaining the model accuracy, i.e., 3x-5x speed-up and energy saving on GoogLeNet with only 0.4% accuracy drop on top-5 categorization in ImageNet. Further, by combining with other model compression techniques, DeepRebirth offers an average of 65ms model forwarding time on each image using Samsung Galaxy S6 with only 2.4% accuracy drop. In addition, 2.5x run-time memory saving is achieved with rebirth layers.","pdf":"/pdf/07809cb17a8725302a9738787085c245669261ea.pdf","keywords":[],"conflicts":["lehigh.edu","samsung.com"],"authors":["Dawei Li","Xiaolong Wang","Deguang Kong","Mooi Choo Chuah"],"authorids":["dal312@lehigh.edu","visionxiaolong@gmail.com","doogkong@gmail.com"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false},{"tddate":null,"replyto":null,"tcdate":1478299167950,"number":526,"tmdate":1478299167950,"id":"SJ_QCYqle","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/submission","forum":"SJ_QCYqle","signatures":["~Evan_Racah1"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["~Evan_Racah1"],"content":{"title":"Semi-Supervised Detection of Extreme Weather Events in Large Climate Datasets","abstract":"The detection and identification of extreme weather events in large scale climate simulations is an important problem for risk management, informing governmental policy decisions and advancing our basic understanding of the climate system.\nRecent work has shown that fully supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can yield acceptable accuracy for classifying well-known types of extreme weather events when large amounts of labeled data are available.

In many real-world tasks, designing a suitable reward function also takes considerable\nmanual engineering, and often requires additional sensors or instrumentation to be installed just measure whether the agent is successful or not. These hand-designed rewards are often extremely sparse, binary and may alter perceptual inputs. Hence even when the outcome of a task can be accurately measured, it does not provide any feedback on the implicit intermediate goals that often exist in more complex multi-stage tasks. The sparse and binary nature of hand-designed rewards in turn yields longer exploration time. Additionally, both Deep Learning and RL suffer from requiring prohibitive amounts of supervision and training time for real-world learning.\nTo address these issues we propose leveraging the abstraction power learned by deep models (e.g. mid to high-level representations of an ImageNet pre-trained Inception model) to quickly infer perceptual reward functions from demonstrations. From only a handful of demonstration sequences, we are able to identify the key intermediate steps of a task and their corresponding discriminative features from a pre-trained deep model. The resulting unsupervised, dense and smooth reward functions can then be used by an agent to learn to perform the demonstrated tasks using RL in real-world settings. We report on the quality of these unsupervised reward functions and show successful end-to-end training on a real robot. Finally, we demonstrate our method can deal with some domain shift by successfully training a robot to open doors using demonstrations provided by a human using their own hand.

Here, we explore prediction of future frames in a video sequence as an unsupervised learning rule for learning about the structure of the visual world. We describe a predictive neural network (\"PredNet\") architecture that is inspired by the concept of \"predictive coding\" from the neuroscience literature. These networks learn to predict future frames in a video sequence, with each layer in the network making local predictions and only forwarding deviations from those predictions to subsequent network layers. We show that these networks are able to robustly learn to predict the movement of synthetic (rendered) objects, and that in doing so, the networks learn  internal representations that are useful for decoding latent object parameters (e.g. pose) that support object recognition with fewer training views. We also show that these networks can scale to complex natural image streams (car-mounted camera videos), capturing key aspects of both egocentric movement and the movement of objects in the visual scene. Furthermore, the representation learned in this setting is useful for estimating the steering angle. These results suggest that prediction represents a powerful framework for unsupervised learning, allowing for implicit learning of object and scene structure.","pdf":"/pdf/afafdf4647f4fbb06579ba840a7e705fbeba7fac.pdf","conflicts":["harvard.edu"],"keywords":[],"authors":["William Lotter","Gabriel Kreiman","David Cox"],"authorids":["lotter@fas.harvard.edu","gabriel.kreiman@tch.harvard.edu","davidcox@fas.harvard.edu"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false},{"tddate":null,"replyto":null,"tcdate":1478297550666,"number":507,"tmdate":1478297550666,"id":"r1PRvK9el","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/submission","forum":"r1PRvK9el","signatures":["~yelong_shen1"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["~yelong_shen1"],"content":{"TL;DR":"","title":"Implicit ReasoNet: Modeling Large-Scale Structured Relationships with Shared Memory","abstract":"Recent studies on knowledge base completion, the task of recovering missing relationships based on recorded relations, demonstrate the importance of learning embeddings from multi-step relations.

We focus here on tasks in which the input is a description of the genetic variation specific to a patient, the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), yielding millions of ternary inputs. Improving the ability of deep learning to handle such datasets could have an important impact in medical research, more specifically in precision medicine, where high-dimensional data regarding a particular patient is used to make predictions of interest. Even though the amount of data for such tasks is increasing, this mismatch between the number of examples and the number of inputs remains a concern. Naive implementations of classifier neural networks involve a huge number of free parameters in their first layer (number of input features times number of hidden units): each input feature is associated with as many parameters as there are hidden units. We propose a novel neural network parametrization which considerably reduces the number of free parameters. It is based on the idea that we can first learn or provide a distributed representation for each input feature (e.g. for each position in the genome where variations are observed in data), and then learn (with another neural network called the parameter prediction network) how to map a feature's distributed representation (based on the feature's identity not its value) to the vector of parameters specific to that feature in the classifier neural network (the weights which link the value of the feature to each of the hidden units). This approach views the problem of producing the parameters associated with each feature as a multi-task learning problem. We show experimentally on a population stratification task of interest to medical studies that the proposed approach can significantly reduce both the number of parameters and the error rate of the classifier.","pdf":"/pdf/abd7c1ce4bf9d8d99d382b4dec9c1997417057ff.pdf","TL;DR":"Drastically reducing the number of parameters, when the number of input features is orders of magnitude larger than the number of training examples, such as in genomics.","conflicts":["umontreal.ca","cvc.uab.es","ub.edu","well.ox.ca.uk","icm.rc.org","mhi-rc.org"],"authors":["Adriana Romero","Pierre Luc Carrier","Akram Erraqabi","Tristan Sylvain","Alex Auvolat","Etienne Dejoie","Marc-André Legault","Julie G.

Given a set of input-output examples, these architectures are able to learn mappings that generalize to new test inputs. While achieving impressive results, these approaches have a number of important limitations: (a) they are computationally expensive and hard to train, (b) a model has to be trained for each task (program) separately, and (c) it is hard to interpret or verify the correctness of the learnt mapping (as it is defined by a neural network). In this paper, we propose a novel technique, Neuro-Symbolic Program Synthesis, to overcome the above-mentioned problems. Once trained, our approach can automatically construct computer programs in a domain-specific language that are consistent with a set of input-output examples provided at test time. Our method is based on two novel neural modules. The first module, called the cross correlation I/O network, given a set of input-output examples, produces a continuous representation of the set of I/O examples. The second module, the Recursive-Reverse-Recursive Neural Network (R3NN), given the continuous representation of the examples, synthesizes a program by incrementally expanding partial programs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the rich and complex domain of regular expression based string transformations. Experiments show that the R3NN model is not only able to construct programs from new input-output examples, but it is also able to construct new programs for tasks that it had never observed before during training.","pdf":"/pdf/47bb2a55fd0db3e08653c64f189d1ce22879125a.pdf","TL;DR":"A neural architecture for learning programs in a domain-specific language that are consistent with a given set of input-output examples","conflicts":["cmu.edu","microsoft.com"],"authors":["Emilio Parisotto","Abdel-rahman Mohamed","Rishabh Singh","Lihong Li","Dengyong Zhou","Pushmeet Kohli"],"keywords":["Deep learning","Structured prediction"],"authorids":["eparisot@andrew.cmu.edu","asamir@microsoft.com","risin@microsoft.com","lihongli@microsoft.com","denzho@microsoft.com","pkohli@microsoft.com"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false},{"ddate":null,"cdate":null,"tddate":null,"replyto":null,"tcdate":1478297213689,"number":497,"tmdate":1478297213689,"id":"rkEFLFqee","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/submission","forum":"rkEFLFqee","signatures":["~Ruben_Villegas1"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["~Ruben_Villegas1"],"content":{"TL;DR":"","title":"Decomposing Motion and Content for Natural Video Sequence Prediction","abstract":"We propose a deep neural network for the prediction of future frames in natural video sequences.

However, real-world applications of such methods require generalizing to the vast variability of the real world. Deep networks are known to achieve remarkable generalization when provided with massive amounts of labeled data, but can we provide this breadth of experience to an RL agent, such as a robot? The robot might continuously learn as it explores the world around it, even while it is deployed and performing useful tasks. However, this learning requires access to a reward function, to tell the agent whether it is succeeding or failing at its task. Such reward functions are often hard to measure in the real world, especially in domains such as robotics and dialog systems, where the reward could depend on the unknown positions of objects or the emotional state of the user. On the other hand, it is often quite practical to provide the agent with reward functions in a limited set of situations, such as when a human supervisor is present, or in a controlled laboratory setting. Can we make use of this limited supervision, and still benefit from the breadth of experience an agent might collect in the unstructured real world? In this paper, we formalize this problem setting as semi-supervised reinforcement learning (SSRL), where the reward function can only be evaluated in a set of “labeled” MDPs, and the agent must generalize its behavior to the wide range of states it might encounter in a set of “unlabeled” MDPs, by using experience from both settings. Our proposed method infers the task objective in the unlabeled MDPs through an algorithm that resembles inverse RL, using the agent’s own prior experience in the labeled MDPs as a kind of demonstration of optimal behavior. We evaluate our method on challenging tasks that require control directly from images, and show that our approach can improve the generalization of a learned deep neural network policy by using experience for which no reward function is available.

Multiple studies tried to analyze and harden classifiers under such adversarial noise (AN). However, they are mostly ad hoc, only applicable to particular classifiers and provide little understanding of the underline principles to evaluate  and improve the robustness of a classier against AN. Rather than suggesting point analysis or solutions, this paper proposes a unified framework using two metric spaces to evaluate  classifiers' robustness against AN and to provide general guidance for hardening such classifiers. The center idea of our framework is that the robustness of a classifier $f_1$ against AN is decided by not only $f_1$ but also its task oracle $f_2$ (like human annotator). In particular, (1) based on the consistency between $f_1$ and $f_2$, we theoretically formulate the strong condition that decides if a classifier is strongly robust against AN; (2) using two metric spaces ($X_1,d_1$) and ($X_2,d_2$) defined by $f_1$ and $f_2$ respectively,  we prove that the topological equivalence between ($X_1,d_1$) and ($X_2,d_2$) is sufficient in deciding whether $f_1$ is robust against AN at test time or not; (3) A novel measure referred as adversarial robustness of classifier (ARC) is defined to quantify how robust a classifier is using expectation of how difficult (wrt $d_2$) to search for adversarial samples.  \n(4) We propose a new defense strategy \"Siamese training\" to intuitively improve topological equivalence between ($X_1,d_1$) and ($X_2,d_2$).  By training original model under Siamese architecture, Siamese Training generates randomly perturbed samples and penalizes the difference between the outputs of the perturbed and outputs of the originals. \nExperiment results show that Siamese training helps multiple DNN models achieve better accuracy comparing to previous defense strategies in an adversarial setting. Based on the proposed measure ARC, DNN models after Siamese training exhibit better robustness than the baselines.","pdf":"/pdf/2b398c2f4f19db9f948b569fba3736d6ccede27d.pdf","TL;DR":"We propose a theoretical framework to explain and measure model robustness and harden DNN model against adversarial attacks.","keywords":["Deep learning"],"authors":["Beilun Wang","Ji Gao","Yanjun Qi"],"conflicts":["virginia.edu","nju.edu.cn","sjtu.edu.cn"],"authorids":["bw4mw@virginia.edu","jg6yd@virginia.edu","yanjun@virginia.edu"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false},{"tddate":null,"replyto":null,"tcdate":1478296900119,"number":484,"tmdate":1478296900119,"id":"B1KBHtcel","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/submission","forum":"B1KBHtcel","signatures":["~Peter_Potash1"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["~Peter_Potash1"],"content":{"title":"Here's My Point: Argumentation Mining with Pointer Networks","abstract":"One of the major goals in automated argumentation mining is to uncover the argument structure present in argumentative text. In order to determine this structure, one must understand how different individual components of the overall argument are linked. General consensus in this field dictates that the argument components form a hierarchy of persuasion, which manifests itself in a tree structure. This work provides the first neural network-based approach to argumentation mining, focusing on extracting links between argument components, with a secondary focus on classifying types of argument components. In order to solve this problem, we propose to use a modification of a Pointer Network architecture. A Pointer Network is appealing for this task for the following reasons: 1) It takes into account the sequential nature of argument components; 2) By construction, it enforces certain properties of the tree structure present in argument relations; 3) The hidden representations can be applied to auxiliary tasks.

In the S (Sparse) step, we regularize the network by pruning the unimportant connections with small weights and retraining the network given the sparsity constraint.

The convolution shares weights across all data points, providing the desired parameter efficiency.  Furthermore, the additional computations in the training process are only executed once in the pre-processing step.  We empirically demonstrate the performance of the proposed CNN on MNIST data set, and challenge the state-of-the-art on Merck molecular activity data set.","pdf":"/pdf/e63a4a327f048657a0d308e5e58b19452b9db447.pdf","TL;DR":"A generalization of CNNs to standard regression and classification problems by using random walk on graph-structure of data.","conflicts":["cmu.edu"],"authors":["Yotam Hechtlinger","Purvasha Chakravarti","Jining Qin"],"keywords":["Supervised Learning","Deep learning"],"authorids":["yhechtli@andrew.cmu.edu","pchakrav@andrew.cmu.edu","jiningq@andrew.cmu.edu"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false},{"tddate":null,"replyto":null,"tcdate":1478294021793,"number":462,"tmdate":1478294021793,"id":"Bkab5dqxe","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/submission","forum":"Bkab5dqxe","signatures":["~Michael_Chang1"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["~Michael_Chang1"],"content":{"title":"A Compositional Object-Based Approach to Learning Physical Dynamics","abstract":"We present the Neural Physics Engine (NPE), an object-based neural network architecture for learning predictive models of intuitive physics.

However, given that in practice training data is scarce for all but a small set of problems, a core question is how to incorporate prior knowledge into a model. Here we consider the case of prior procedural knowledge, such as knowing the overall recursive structure of a sequence transduction program or the fact that a program will likely use arithmetic operations on real numbers to solve a task. To this end we present a differentiable interpreter for the programming language Forth. Through a neural implementation of the dual stack machine that underlies Forth, programmers can write program sketches with slots that can be filled with behaviour trained from program input-output data. As the program interpreter is end-to-end differentiable, we can optimize this behaviour directly through gradient descent techniques on user specified objectives, and also integrate the program into any larger neural computation graph. We show empirically that our interpreter is able to effectively leverage different levels of prior program structure and learn complex transduction tasks such as sequence sorting or addition with substantially less data and better generalisation over problem sizes. In addition, we introduce neural program optimisations based on symbolic computation and parallel branching that lead to significant speed improvements.

By systematically manipulating the problem difficulty and the cost incurred by the agent for performing experiments, we found that agents learn different strategies that balance the cost of gathering information against the cost of making mistakes in different situations.\n","pdf":"/pdf/c1b893b488cee0ccb5f6cacfd4aeebff5bf84fed.pdf","TL;DR":"We train agents to conduct experiments in interactive simulated physical environments.","conflicts":["google.com","berkeley.edu"],"authors":["Misha Denil","Pulkit Agrawal","Tejas D Kulkarni","Tom Erez","Peter Battaglia","Nando de Freitas"],"keywords":["Reinforcement Learning","Deep learning"],"authorids":["mdenil@google.com","pulkitag@berkeley.edu","tkulkarni@google.com","etom@google.com","peterbattaglia@google.com","nandodefreitas@google.com"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false},{"tddate":null,"replyto":null,"tcdate":1478290741445,"number":442,"tmdate":1478290741445,"id":"ryT4pvqll","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/submission","forum":"ryT4pvqll","signatures":["~Ofir_Nachum1"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["~Ofir_Nachum1"],"content":{"title":"Improving Policy Gradient by Exploring Under-appreciated Rewards","abstract":"This paper presents a novel form of policy gradient for model-free reinforcement learning (RL) with improved exploration properties. Current policy-based methods use entropy regularization to encourage undirected exploration of the reward landscape, which is ineffective in high dimensional spaces with sparse rewards. We propose a more directed exploration strategy that promotes exploration of under-appreciated reward regions. An action sequence is considered under-appreciated if its log-probability under the current policy under-estimates its resulting reward. The proposed exploration strategy is easy to implement, requiring only small modifications to the standard REINFORCE algorithm. We evaluate the approach on a set of algorithmic tasks that have long challenged RL methods. We find that our approach reduces hyper-parameter sensitivity and demonstrates significant improvements over baseline methods. Notably, the approach is able to solve a benchmark multi-digit addition task. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a pure RL method has solved addition using only reward feedback.","pdf":"/pdf/c273fd34583db2810e52336a49748afb93fcb27e.pdf","TL;DR":"We present a novel form of policy gradient for model-free reinforcement learning with improved exploration properties.","keywords":["Reinforcement Learning"],"conflicts":["google.com","ualberta.ca"],"authors":["Ofir Nachum","Mohammad Norouzi","Dale Schuurmans"],"authorids":["ofirnachum@google.com","mnorouzi@google.com","schuurmans@google.com"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false},{"tddate":null,"replyto":null,"tcdate":1478290724977,"number":441,"tmdate":1478290724977,"id":"HJTXaw9gx","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/submission","forum":"HJTXaw9gx","signatures":["~Vicenç_Rubies_Royo1"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["~Vicenç_Rubies_Royo1"],"content":{"title":"Recursive Regression with Neural Networks: Approximating the HJI PDE Solution","abstract":"Most machine learning applications using neural networks seek to approximate some function g(x) by minimizing some cost criterion.

This stems from a long standing question. Given that deep networks are highly nonlinear systems optimized by local gradient methods, why do they not seem to be affected by bad local minima? In a paper by Dauphin et. al. a conjecture had been put forward to answer this question which is based on recent results from statistical physics literature. The argument is that  as the model size increases, the error surface of neural networks converges to a particular useful structure, where all local minima align closely to the global minimum in terms of performance, and, most critical points of the error surface are actually saddle points.\nIn this work we look at the particular case of finite size datasets. We argue that in this scenario one can construct counter-examples (datasets or initialization schemes) when the network becomes  susceptible to many bad local minima over the weight space. Empirically we know, however, that deep models can reach reliably good solutions. We believe that the reason why learning is well behaved for many practical problems has to do with the nature of the task together with the initialization of the model. Significant headway in understanding neural networks has to come from accurately describing or understanding the family of tasks for which they work well, probably together with the region of weight space where this is true.","pdf":"/pdf/99657ea7be0deca31a6a6c2d7c38508504233127.pdf","TL;DR":"As a contribution to the discussion about error surface and the question why \"deep and cheap\" learning works so well we present concrete examples of local minima and obstacles arising in the training of deep models.","conflicts":["google.com"],"keywords":["Theory","Deep learning","Supervised Learning","Optimization"],"authors":["Grzegorz Swirszcz","Wojciech Marian Czarnecki","Razvan Pascanu"],"authorids":["swirszcz@google.com","lejlot@google.com","razp@google.com"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false},{"tddate":null,"replyto":null,"tcdate":1478290057546,"number":417,"tmdate":1478290057546,"id":"B1-q5Pqxl","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/submission","forum":"B1-q5Pqxl","signatures":["~Shuohang_Wang1"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["~Shuohang_Wang1"],"content":{"title":"Machine Comprehension Using Match-LSTM and Answer Pointer","abstract":"Machine comprehension of text is an important problem in natural language processing.

We present a novel hierarchical deep RL architecture that consists of two interacting neural controllers: a meta controller that reads instructions and repeatedly communicates subtasks to a subtask controller that in turn learns to perform such subtasks.

For an agent with a limited computational budget, this \"one-size-fits-all\" approach may result in the agent wasting valuable computation on easy examples, while not spending enough on hard examples. Rather than learning a single, fixed policy for solving all instances of a task, we introduce a metacontroller which learns to optimize a sequence of \"imagined\" internal simulations over predictive models of the world in order to construct a more informed, and more economical, solution. The metacontroller component is a model-free reinforcement learning agent, which decides both how many iterations of the optimization procedure to run, as well as which model to consult on each iteration. The models (which we call \"experts\") can be state transition models, action-value functions, or any other mechanism that provides information useful for solving the task, and can be learned on-policy or off-policy in parallel with the metacontroller. When the metacontroller, controller, and experts were trained with \"interaction networks\" (Battaglia et al., 2016) as expert models, our approach was able to solve a challenging decision-making problem under complex non-linear dynamics. The metacontroller learned to adapt the amount of computation it performed to the difficulty of the task, and learned how to choose which experts to consult by factoring in both their reliability and individual computational resource costs. This allowed the metacontroller to achieve a lower overall cost (task loss plus computational cost) than more traditional fixed policy approaches. These results demonstrate that our approach is a powerful framework for using rich forward models for efficient model-based reinforcement learning.","pdf":"/pdf/1693bf31d636976897b4a2fe5d18a9a46d0630fd.pdf","TL;DR":"We present a \"metacontroller\" neural architecture which can adaptively decide how long to run an model-based online optimization procedure for, and which models to use during the optimization.","conflicts":["berkeley.edu","google.com","mit.edu"],"authors":["Jessica B.

The challenge is due to both the size of the model and the time it takes to evaluate it.

At the end of training, the parameters of the network are sparse while accuracy is still close to the original dense neural network. The network size is reduced by 8× and the time required to train the model remains constant. Additionally, we can prune a larger dense network to achieve better than baseline performance while still reducing the total number of parameters significantly.

In the setting of Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs) a popular estimator is a maximum likelihood objective with a penalization on the precision matrix. Adapting this estimator to capture domain-specific knowledge as priors or a new data likelihood requires great effort. In addition, structure recovery is an indirect consequence of the data-fit term. By contrast, it may be easier to generate training samples of data that arise from graphs with the desired structure properties. We propose here to leverage this latter source of information as training data to learn a function mapping from empirical covariance matrices to estimated graph structures.  Learning this function brings two benefits: it implicitly models the desired structure or sparsity properties to form suitable priors, and it can be tailored to the specific problem of edge structure discovery, rather than maximizing data likelihood. We apply this framework to several real-world problems in structure discovery and show that it can be competitive to standard approaches such as graphical lasso, at a fraction of the execution speed. We use convolutional neural networks to parametrize our estimators due to the compositional structure of the problem. Experimentally, our learnable graph-discovery method trained on synthetic data generalizes well to different data: identifying relevant edges in real data, completely unknown at training time. We find that on genetics, brain imaging, and simulation data we obtain competitive(and generally superior) performance, compared with analytical\nmethods.

In the online learning setting, where new input instances arrive sequentially in batches, the “neuronal birth” is implemented by adding new units with random initial weights (random dictionary elements); the number of new units is determined by the current performance (representation error) of the dictionary, higher error causing an increase in the birth rate. “Neuronal death” is implemented by imposing l1/l2-regularization (group sparsity) on the dictionary within the block-coordinate descent optimization at each iteration of our online alternating minimization scheme, which iterates between the code and dictionary updates. Finally, hidden unit connectivity adaptation is facilitated by introducing sparsity in dictionary elements. Our empirical evaluation on several real-life datasets (images and language) as well as on synthetic data demonstrates that the proposed approach can considerably outperform the state-of-art fixed-size (nonadaptive) online sparse coding of Mairal et al.

Equally ubiquitous is the usage of beam search (BS) as an approximate inference algorithm to decode output sequences from these models. BS explores the search space in a greedy left-right fashion retaining only the top B candidates. This tends to result in sequences that differ only slightly from each other. Producing lists of nearly identical sequences is not only computationally wasteful but also typically fails to capture the inherent ambiguity of complex AI tasks. To overcome this problem, we propose Diverse Beam Search (DBS), an alternative to BS that decodes a list of diverse outputs by optimizing a diversity-augmented objective. We observe that our method not only improved diversity but also finds better top 1 solutions by controlling for the exploration and exploitation of the search space. Moreover, these gains are achieved with minimal computational or memory overhead com- pared to beam search. To demonstrate the broad applicability of our method, we present results on image captioning, machine translation, conversation and visual question generation using both standard quantitative metrics and qualitative human studies.

The sparsity structure of the network is identified using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), which is widely used in large optimization problems. This method alternates between promoting the sparsity of the network and optimizing the recognition performance, which allows us to exploit the two-part structure of the corresponding objective functions.

Code-optimization has been the subject of years of research that has resulted in the development of rule-based transformation strategies that are used by compilers. More recently, however, a class of stochastic search based methods have been shown to outperform these strategies. This approach involves repeated sampling of modifications to the program from a proposal distribution, which are accepted or rejected based on whether they preserve correctness, and the improvement they achieve. These methods, however, neither learn from past behaviour nor do they try to leverage the semantics of the program under consideration. Motivated by this observation, we present a novel learning based approach for code super-optimization. Intuitively, our method works by learning the proposal distribution using unbiased estimators of the gradient of the expected improvement.

The tightness of the variational bound relies on gradually increasing temperature as we walk away from the data, at each step providing a gradient on the parameters to maximize the probability that the transition operator returns to its previous state. Interestingly, this algorithm admits a variant where there is no explicit energy function, i.e., the parameters are used to directly define the transition operator. This also eliminates the explicit need for symmetric weights which previous Boltzmann machine or Hopfield net models require, and which makes these models less biologically plausible.","pdf":"/pdf/b4318ec131f81c8a25e8dbfb41b38acf262d2807.pdf","TL;DR":"A new algorithm for training undirected graphical models.","keywords":["Unsupervised Learning"],"conflicts":["umontreal.ca","amazon.com"],"authors":["Anirudh Goyal","Nan Rosemary Ke","Alex Lamb","Yoshua Bengio"],"authorids":["anirudhgoyal9119@gmail.com","rosemary.nan.ke@gmail.com","lambalex@iro.umontreal.ca","yoshua.umontreal@gmail.com"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false},{"tddate":null,"replyto":null,"tcdate":1478286375183,"number":327,"tmdate":1478286375183,"id":"SJJN38cge","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/submission","forum":"SJJN38cge","signatures":["~Arash_Shahriari1"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["~Arash_Shahriari1"],"content":{"TL;DR":"","title":"Distributed Transfer Learning for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks by Basic Probability Assignment","abstract":"Transfer learning is a highly popular practice in deep neural networks but fine-tuning of large number of parameters is a hard challenge due to the complex wiring of neurons between splitting layers and imbalance class coverage among original and transferred domains.

However, the most prevalent regularizations do not leverage all the capacity of the models since they rely on reducing the effective number of parameters. Feature decorrelation is an alternative for using the full capacity of the models but the overfitting reduction margins are too narrow given the overhead it introduces. In this paper, we show that regularizing negatively correlated features is an obstacle for effective decorrelation and present OrthoReg, a novel regularization technique that locally enforces feature orthogonality. As a result, imposing locality constraints in feature decorrelation removes interferences between negatively correlated features, allowing the regularizer to reach higher decorrelation bounds, and reducing the overfitting more effectively. \nIn particular, we show that the models regularized with OrthoReg have higher accuracy bounds even when batch normalization and dropout present. Moreover, since our regularization is directly performed on the weights, it is especially suitable for fully convolutional neural networks, where the weight space is constant compared to the feature map space. As a result, we are able to reduce the overfitting of state-of-the-art CNNs on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN.","pdf":"/pdf/e07cea5b325065d41c55d961dceab5f99f209b2b.pdf","TL;DR":"We show that that models regularized with local feature decorrelation have lower overfitting.","conflicts":["cvc.uab.es","uab.es","uab.cat","cvc.uab.cat"],"authors":["Pau Rodríguez","Jordi Gonzàlez","Guillem Cucurull","Josep M.

While many continuous random variables have such reparameterizations, discrete random variables lack continuous reparameterizations due to the discontinuous nature of discrete states. In this work we introduce concrete random variables -- continuous relaxations of discrete random variables. The concrete distribution is a new family of distributions with closed form densities and a simple reparameterization. Whenever a discrete stochastic node of a computation graph can be refactored into a one-hot bit representation that is treated continuously, concrete stochastic nodes can be used with automatic differentiation to produce low-variance biased gradients of objectives (including objectives that depend on the log-probability of latent stochastic nodes) on the corresponding discrete graph.

Recently, various methods for incorporating differentiable memory into these architectures have been proposed. When predicting the next token, these models query information from a memory of the recent history and thus can facilitate learning mid- and long-range dependencies. However, conventional attention models produce a single output vector per time step that is used for predicting the next token as well as the key and value of a differentiable memory of the history of tokens. In this paper, we propose a key-value attention mechanism that produces separate representations for the key and value of a memory, and for a representation that encodes the next-word distribution. This usage of past memories outperforms existing memory-augmented neural language models on two corpora. Yet, we found that it mainly utilizes past memory only of the previous five representations. This led to the unexpected main finding that a much simpler model which simply uses a concatenation of output representations from the previous three-time steps is on par with more sophisticated memory-augmented neural language models.","pdf":"/pdf/8b5ab672ac537a7643436c410c57f4573c4842b9.pdf","TL;DR":"We investigate various memory-augmented neural language models and compare them against state-of-the-art architectures.","conflicts":["cs.ucl.ac.uk","ucl.ac.uk","google.com","informatik.hu-berlin.de","cs.umass.edu"],"authors":["Michał Daniluk","Tim Rocktäschel","Johannes Welbl","Sebastian Riedel"],"keywords":["Natural language processing","Deep learning"],"authorids":["michal.daniluk.15@ucl.ac.uk","t.rocktaschel@cs.ucl.ac.uk","j.welbl@cs.ucl.ac.uk","s.riedel@cs.ucl.ac.uk"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false},{"tddate":null,"replyto":null,"tcdate":1478285161774,"number":300,"tmdate":1478285161774,"id":"HJGODLqgx","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/submission","forum":"HJGODLqgx","signatures":["~Hanjun_Dai1"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["~Hanjun_Dai1"],"content":{"title":"Recurrent Hidden Semi-Markov Model","abstract":"Segmentation and labeling of high dimensional time series data has wide applications in behavior understanding and medical diagnosis. Due to the difficulty in obtaining the label information for high dimensional data, realizing this objective in an unsupervised way is highly desirable. Hidden Semi-Markov Model (HSMM) is a classical tool for this problem. However, existing HSMM and its variants has simple conditional assumptions of observations, thus the ability to capture the nonlinear and complex dynamics within segments is limited. To tackle this limitation, we propose to incorporate the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to model the generative process in HSMM, resulting the Recurrent HSMM (R-HSMM). To accelerate the inference while preserving accuracy, we designed a structure encoding function to mimic the exact inference. By generalizing the penalty method to distribution space, we are able to train the model and the encoding function simultaneously. Empirical results show that the proposed R-HSMM achieves the state-of-the-art performances on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Recently, some studies handle multiple modalities on deep generative models, such as variational autoencoders (VAEs). However, these models typically assume that modalities are forced to have a conditioned relation, i.e., we can only generate modalities in one direction. To achieve our objective, we should extract a joint representation that captures high-level concepts among all modalities and through which we can exchange them bi-directionally. As described herein, we propose a joint multimodal variational autoencoder (JMVAE), in which all modalities are independently conditioned on joint representation. In other words, it models a joint distribution of modalities. Furthermore, to be able to generate missing modalities from the remaining modalities properly, we develop an additional method, JMVAE-kl, that is trained by reducing the divergence between JMVAE's encoder and prepared networks of respective modalities. Our experiments show that our proposed method can obtain appropriate joint representation from multiple modalities and that it can generate and reconstruct them more properly than conventional VAEs.

We propose Dynamic Variable Effort Deep Neural Networks (DyVEDeep), which exploit the heterogeneity in the characteristics of inputs to DNNs to improve their compute efficiency while maintaining the same classification accuracy. DyVEDeep equips DNNs with dynamic effort knobs, which in course of processing an input, identify how critical a group of computations are to classify the input. DyVEDeep dynamically focuses its compute effort only on the critical computations, while the skipping/approximating the rest. We propose 3 effort knobs that operate at different levels of granularity viz. neuron, feature and layer levels. We build DyVEDeep versions for 5 popular image recognition benchmarks on 3 image datasets---MNIST, CIFAR and ImageNet.

For each  weight entry in a deep net, HFH uses multiple low-cost hash functions to fetch values in a compression space, and then employs a small reconstruction network to recover that entry. The compression space is homological because all layers fetch hashed values from it. The reconstruction network is plugged into the whole network and trained jointly. On several benchmark datasets, HFH demonstrates high compression ratios with little loss on prediction accuracy. Particularly, HFH includes the recently proposed HashedNets as a degenerated scenario and shows significantly improved performance.

Much of this progress has been achieved through devising recurrent units and architectures with the flexibility to capture complex statistics in the data, such as long range dependency or dependency on specific parts of the sequence (attention mechanisms). However, while many sequential data (such as video, speech or language) can have highly variable information flow, most recurrent models still consume input features at a constant rate and perform a constant number of computations per time step, which can be detrimental to both speed and model capacity. In this paper, we explore a modification to existing recurrent units which allows them to learn to vary the amount of computation they perform at each step as required, without prior knowledge of the sequence's time structure. We show experimentally that not only is our model more computationally efficient, it also leads to better performance overall on our evaluation tasks.","pdf":"/pdf/fecc5a7b354cc2d62a0ce125585185b3ccbe1c26.pdf","TL;DR":"We show that an RNN can learn to control the amount of computation it does at each time step, leading to better efficiency and performance as well as discovering time patterns of interest.","conflicts":["nyu.edu","fb.com"],"authors":["Yacine Jernite","Edouard Grave","Armand Joulin","Tomas Mikolov"],"keywords":["Deep learning","Natural language processing"],"authorids":["yacine.jernite@nyu.edu","egrave@fb.com","ajoulin@fb.com","tmikolov@fb.com"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false},{"tddate":null,"replyto":null,"tcdate":1478280235978,"number":245,"tmdate":1478280235978,"id":"BkV4VS9ll","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/submission","forum":"BkV4VS9ll","signatures":["~Aditya_Sharma1"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["~Aditya_Sharma1"],"content":{"TL;DR":"","title":"The Incredible Shrinking Neural Network: New Perspectives on Learning Representations Through The Lens of Pruning","abstract":"How much can pruning algorithms teach us about the fundamentals of learning representations in neural networks? A lot, it turns out. Neural network model compression has become a topic of great interest in recent years, and many different techniques have been proposed to address this problem. In general, this is motivated by the idea that smaller models typically lead to better generalization. At the same time, the decision of what to prune and when to prune necessarily forces us to confront our assumptions about how neural networks actually learn to represent patterns in data. In this work we set out to test several long-held hypotheses about neural network learning representations and numerical approaches to pruning. To accomplish this we first reviewed the historical literature and derived a novel algorithm to prune whole neurons (as opposed to the traditional method of pruning weights) from optimally trained networks using a second-order Taylor method. We then set about testing the performance of our algorithm and analyzing the quality of the decisions it made. As a baseline for comparison we used a first-order Taylor method based on the Skeletonization algorithm and an exhaustive brute-force serial pruning algorithm. Our proposed algorithm worked well compared to a first-order method, but not nearly as well as the brute-force method. Our error analysis led us to question the validity of many widely-held assumptions behind pruning algorithms in general and the trade-offs we often make in the interest of reducing computational complexity. We discovered that there is a straightforward way, however expensive, to serially prune 40-70\\% of the neurons in a trained network with minimal effect on the learning representation and without any re-training.

The environment is expandable, allowing for more video games and consoles to be easily added to the environment, while maintaining the same interface as ALE. Moreover, RLE is compatible with Python and Torch. SNES games pose a significant challenge to current algorithms due to their higher level of complexity and versatility.

In contrast, animals can learn new tasks in just a few trials, benefiting from their prior knowledge about the world. This paper seeks to bridge this gap. Rather than designing a “fast” reinforcement learning algorithm, we propose to represent it as a recurrent neural network (RNN) and learn it from data. In our proposed method, RL^2, the algorithm is encoded in the weights of the RNN, which are learned slowly through a general-purpose (“slow”) RL algorithm. The RNN receives all information a typical RL algorithm would receive, including observations, actions, rewards, and termination flags; and it retains its state across episodes in a given Markov Decision Process (MDP). The activations of the RNN store the state of the “fast” RL algorithm on the current (previously unseen) MDP. We evaluate RL^2 experimentally on both small-scale and large-scale problems. On the small-scale side, we train it to solve randomly generated multi-arm bandit problems and finite MDPs. After RL^2 is trained, its performance on new MDPs is close to human-designed algorithms with optimality guarantees. On the large-scale side, we test RL^2 on a vision-based navigation task and show that it scales up to high-dimensional problems.","pdf":"/pdf/fcf5472e35e20600e83d55c2a6bf213dd25a3e94.pdf","TL;DR":"We propose to learn a “fast” reinforcement learning algorithm using standard, off-the-shelf (“slow”) reinforcement learning algorithms, where the “fast” version is represented as an RNN, and fast RL happens inside its activations.","conflicts":["openai.com","berkeley.edu","eecs.berkeley.edu"],"authors":["Yan Duan","John Schulman","Xi Chen","Peter L.

Here, the weights learned for the binary classifiers can be considered as weights between two successive layers, while the outputs of the combined binary classifiers as the outputs of a hidden layer.

Hence, the supervised pre-training of DeepECOC is in general very effective and efficient. We have conducted extensive experiments to compare DeepECOC with traditional ECOC, feature learning and deep learning algorithms on several benchmark data sets. The results demonstrate that DeepECOC perform not only better than traditional ECOC and feature learning algorithms, but also state-of the-art deep learning models in most cases.

We investigate probabilistic models on real-world bioacoustic sound scenes to represent the signal. We study sequential models like Hidden Markov Models (HMMs); HMM is able to infer hidden states, that are referred here as song units. However, using such a model raise one main issue: defining the number of hidden states the model has to learn. In bioacoustic problems we often do not know the number of song units (unlike in human speech recognition). Hence, we work with the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP)-HMM, which is a Bayesian non-parametric (BNP) model that offers a way to tackle this challenging problem. We focus our work on unsupervised learning from bioacoustic data. It consists in simultaneously finding the structure of hidden song units and automatically infer the unknown number of the hidden states to represent the data. Two real bioacoustic sound scene applications are investigated in this work: on whale and multi-species birds segmentation. The learning of these models is proceeded by using Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling techniques on Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) of audio signals. The results show an interesting song unit segmentation of the bioacoustic signals and open new insights for unsupervised analysis of such signals. This pa- per illustrates the potential of chunking non-human animal signals into structured parts. This can yield to a new species representation and help experts to better understand and interpret such species.","pdf":"/pdf/e8676c79e4ee81cfde3243e1399997a4dc708a4a.pdf","conflicts":["no conflict : common direction of Phd thesis"],"keywords":[],"authors":["Vincent Roger","Marius Bartcus","Faicel Chamroukhi","Hervé Glotin"],"authorids":["vincent-roger@etud.univ-tln.fr","marius.bartcus@gmail.com","faicel.chamroukhi@unicaen.fr","glotin@univ-tln.fr"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false},{"tddate":null,"replyto":null,"tcdate":1478273214409,"number":195,"tmdate":1478273214409,"id":"Bk8aOm9xl","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/submission","forum":"Bk8aOm9xl","signatures":["~Joshua_Achiam1"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["~Joshua_Achiam1"],"content":{"title":"Surprise-Based Intrinsic Motivation for Deep Reinforcement Learning","abstract":"Exploration in complex domains is a key challenge in reinforcement learning, especially for tasks with very sparse rewards.

Here, we consider more complex heuristics: efficient and scalable exploration strategies that maximize a notion of an agent's surprise about its experiences via intrinsic motivation. We propose to learn a model of the MDP transition probabilities concurrently with the policy, and to form intrinsic rewards that approximate the KL-divergence of the true transition probabilities from the learned model. One of our approximations results in using surprisal as intrinsic motivation, while the other gives the $k$-step learning progress.

Experiments demonstrate that the proposed model generates a smoother volatility estimation, and largely outperforms a widely used GARCH model on several metrics about the fitness of the volatility modelling and the accuracy of the prediction.","pdf":"/pdf/a46afb39697e7503c0e699c466c96d9253aeac4b.pdf","TL;DR":"A novel integration of statistical models with recurrent neural networks providing a new way of formulating volatility models.","conflicts":["cs.ucl.ac.uk","apex.sjtu.edu.cn"],"authors":["Rui Luo","Xiaojun Xu","Weinan Zhang","Jun Wang"],"keywords":["Deep learning","Supervised Learning"],"authorids":["r.luo@cs.ucl.ac.uk","xuxj@apex.sjtu.edu.cn","wnzhang@apex.sjtu.edu.cn","j.wang@cs.ucl.ac.uk"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false},{"tddate":null,"replyto":null,"tcdate":1478272223629,"number":191,"tmdate":1478272223629,"id":"Sk_JHmqxl","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/submission","forum":"Sk_JHmqxl","signatures":["~Chen_Zhang1"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["~Chen_Zhang1"],"content":{"TL;DR":"","title":"Statistical Analysis of Simulation Outputs from Parallel Computing","abstract":"This paper addresses the statistical output analysis of tran- sient simulation in the parallel computing environment with limited computing time.

Unlike related methods which are struggled in noticeable accuracy loss, INQ has the potential of resolving this common issue, as benefiting from two innovations. On one hand, we introduce three interdependent operations, namely weight partition, group-wise quantization and re-training. A well-proven measure is employed to divide the weights in each layer of a pre-trained CNN model into two groups. The weights in the first group are responsible to form a low-precision base of the original model, thus they are quantized into low-precision ones by a mapping function, while the weights in the other group are responsible to compensate for the accuracy loss due to quantization, thus they are the ones to be re-trained. On the other hand, these three operations are repeated on the latest re-trained weight group in an iterative manner until all the weights are converted to low-precision ones, acting as an incremental quantization and enhancement procedure. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet classification task using known deep CNN architectures including AlexNet, VGG-16, GoogleNet and ResNets well testify the efficacy of the proposed INQ. Specifically, at 5-bit (i.e., 4 bits for powers of two plus 1 bit for zero) quantization, it yields improved accuracy when compared with the 32-bit floating-point references, shedding new insight on how to make deep CNNs to be applicable on mobile or embedded devices. Taking ResNet-18 as an example, we further show that our quantized models with 4-bit, 3-bit and 2-bit ternary weights also have improved or very similar accuracy as its 32-bit floating-point baseline. The code will be made publicly available.","pdf":"/pdf/daf1daef38f20848c3af86722eae3ab6fbd3ef09.pdf","TL;DR":"This paper presents INQ, targeting to efficiently transform any pre-trained full-precision convolutional neural network (CNN) model into a low-precision version whose connection weights are constrained to be either powers of two or zero.","authors":["Aojun Zhou","Anbang Yao","Yiwen Guo","Lin Xu","Yurong Chen"],"conflicts":["intel.com","tsinghua.edu.cn","ia.ac.cn"],"keywords":["Deep learning","Optimization"],"authorids":["aojun.zhou@intel.com","anbang.yao@intel.com","yiwen.guo@intel.com","lin.x.xu@intel.com","yurong.chen@intel.com"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false},{"tddate":null,"replyto":null,"tcdate":1478271160337,"number":188,"tmdate":1478271160337,"id":"Bkepl7cee","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/submission","forum":"Bkepl7cee","signatures":["~Ludovic_Trottier1"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["~Ludovic_Trottier1"],"content":{"title":"Parametric Exponential Linear Unit for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","abstract":"The activation function is an important component in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

We conducted several experiments on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet with different network architectures, such as NiN, Overfeat, All-CNN and ResNet. Our results show that our PELU has relative error improvements over ELU of 4.45% and 5.68% on CIFAR-10 and 100, and as much as 7.28% with only 0.0003% parameter increase on ImageNet. We also observed that Vgg using PELU tended to prefer activations saturating closer to zero, as in ReLU, except at the last layer, which saturated near -2.

We develop likelihood-free inference methods and highlight hypothesis testing as a principle for learning in implicit generative models, using which we are able to derive the objective function used by GANs, and many other related objectives. The testing viewpoint directs our focus to the general problem of density ratio estimation. There are four approaches for density ratio estimation, one of which is a solution using classifiers to distinguish real from generated data.

Recent work on program induction has proposed neural architectures, based on abstractions like stacks, Turing machines, and interpreters,  that operate on abstract computational machines or on execution traces. But the recursive abstraction that is central to procedural knowledge is perhaps most naturally represented by symbolic representations that have syntactic structure, such as logical expressions and source code. Combining abstract, symbolic reasoning with continuous neural reasoning is a grand challenge of representation learning. As a step in this direction, we propose a new architecture, called neural equivalence networks, for the problem of learning continuous semantic representations of mathematical and logical expressions. These networks are trained to represent semantic equivalence, even of expressions that are syntactically very different. The challenge is that semantic representations must be computed in a syntax-directed manner, because semantics is compositional, but at the same time, small changes in syntax can lead to very large changes in semantics, which can be difficult for continuous neural architectures.

It compresses the size of the storage for a large number of network parameters in a neural network by quantizing them and encoding the quantized values into binary codewords of smaller sizes. In this paper, we aim to design network quantization schemes that minimize the expected loss due to quantization while maximizing the compression ratio. To this end, we analyze the quantitative relation of quantization errors to the loss function of a neural network and identify that the Hessian-weighted distortion measure is locally the right objective function that we need to optimize for minimizing the loss due to quantization. As a result, Hessian-weighted k-means clustering is proposed for clustering network parameters to quantize when fixed-length binary encoding follows. When optimal variable-length binary codes, e.g., Huffman codes, are employed for further compression of quantized values after clustering, we derive that the network quantization problem can be related to the entropy-constrained scalar quantization (ECSQ) problem in information theory and consequently propose two solutions of ECSQ for network quantization, i.e., uniform quantization and an iterative algorithm similar to Lloyd's algorithm for k-means clustering. Finally, using the simple uniform quantization followed by Huffman coding, our experiment results show that the compression ratios of 51.25, 22.17 and 40.65 are achievable (i.e., the sizes of the compressed models are 1.95%, 4.51% and 2.46% of the original model sizes) for LeNet, ResNet and AlexNet, respectively, at no or marginal performance loss.","pdf":"/pdf/40e1afedbd477b2006580b6f9441c1f5f99c5eb2.pdf","conflicts":["samsung.com"],"keywords":["Deep learning","Theory"],"authors":["Yoojin Choi","Mostafa El-Khamy","Jungwon Lee"],"authorids":["yoojin.c@samsung.com","mostafa.e@samsung.com","jungwon2.lee@samsung.com"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false},{"tddate":null,"replyto":null,"tcdate":1478246548477,"number":147,"tmdate":1478246548477,"id":"HJhcg6Fxg","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/submission","forum":"HJhcg6Fxg","signatures":["~Karol_Grzegorczyk1"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["~Karol_Grzegorczyk1"],"content":{"title":"Binary Paragraph Vectors","abstract":"Recently Le & Mikolov described two log-linear models, called Paragraph Vector, that can be used to learn state-of-the-art distributed representations of documents.

In particular, we show that any sparse polynomial function of a sparse binary vector can be computed from a compact sketch by a single-layer neural network, where the sketch size has a logarithmic dependence on the polynomial degree.\n                                                                                                                                                           \nA practical consequence is that networks trained on sketched data are compact, and therefore suitable for settings with memory and power constraints. We empirically show that our approach leads to networks with fewer parameters than related methods such as feature hashing, at equal or better performance.","pdf":"/pdf/12c6f024bbb3f85ab2cd5f9508d5b6f14eafce85.pdf","TL;DR":"For sparse boolean inputs, Neural Networks operating on very short sketches can provably and empirically represent a large class of functions.","conflicts":["google.com"],"authors":["Amit Daniely","Nevena Lazic","Yoram Singer","Kunal Talwar"],"keywords":["Theory"],"authorids":["amitdaniely@google.com","nevena@google.com","singer@google.com","kunal@google.com"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false},{"tddate":null,"replyto":null,"tcdate":1478244115139,"number":135,"tmdate":1478244115139,"id":"rksfwnFxl","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/submission","forum":"rksfwnFxl","signatures":["~Sungroh_Yoon1"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["~Sungroh_Yoon1"],"content":{"TL;DR":"","title":"LSTM-Based System-Call Language Modeling and Ensemble Method for Host-Based Intrusion Detection","abstract":"In computer security, designing a robust intrusion detection system is one of the most fundamental and important problems.

MAC introduces an auxiliary coordinate for each data point in order to decouple the nested model into independent submodels. This decomposes the optimisation into steps that alternate between training single layers and updating the coordinates. It has the advantage that it reuses existing single-layer algorithms, introduces parallelism, and does not need to use chain-rule gradients, so it works with nondifferentiable layers. We describe ParMAC, a distributed-computation model for MAC. This trains on a dataset distributed across machines while limiting the amount of communication so it does not obliterate the benefit of parallelism. ParMAC works on a cluster of machines with a circular topology and alternates two steps until convergence: one step trains the submodels in parallel using stochastic updates, and the other trains the coordinates in parallel. Only submodel parameters, no data or coordinates, are ever communicated between machines. ParMAC exhibits high parallelism, low communication overhead, and facilitates data shuffling, load balancing, fault tolerance and streaming data processing.

Moreover, suggestion engines in modern IDEs do not propose expressions or multi-statement idiomatic code. Recent work has shown that language models can improve code suggestion systems by learning from software repositories. This paper introduces a neural language model with a sparse pointer network aimed at capturing very long range dependencies. We release a large-scale code suggestion corpus of 41M lines of Python code crawled from GitHub. On this corpus, we found standard neural language models to perform well at suggesting local phenomena, but struggle to refer to identifiers that are introduced many tokens in the past. By augmenting a neural language model with a pointer network specialized in referring to predefined classes of identifiers, we obtain a much lower perplexity and a 5 percentage points increase in accuracy for code suggestion compared to an LSTM baseline. In fact, this increase in code suggestion accuracy is due to a 13 times more accurate prediction of identifiers. Furthermore, a qualitative analysis shows this model indeed captures interesting long-range dependencies, like referring to a class member defined over 60 tokens in the past.","pdf":"/pdf/eb1d9869e9d901de1f93986c1101e7d0c18551bb.pdf","TL;DR":"We augment a neural language model with a pointer network for code suggestion that is specialized to referring to predefined groups of identifiers","keywords":[],"conflicts":["cs.ucl.ac.uk","ucl.ac.uk","google.com","informatik.hu-berlin.de","cs.umass.edu","ed.ac.uk"],"authors":["Avishkar Bhoopchand","Tim Rocktäschel","Earl Barr","Sebastian Riedel"],"authorids":["avishkar.bhoopchand.15@ucl.ac.uk","t.rocktaschel@cs.ucl.ac.uk","e.barr@cs.ucl.ac.uk","s.riedel@cs.ucl.ac.uk"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false},{"tddate":null,"replyto":null,"tcdate":1478209093753,"number":88,"tmdate":1478209093753,"id":"SJAr0QFxe","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/submission","forum":"SJAr0QFxe","signatures":["~Sihan_Li1"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["~Sihan_Li1"],"content":{"TL;DR":"","title":"Demystifying ResNet","abstract":"We provide a theoretical explanation for the superb performance of ResNet via the study of deep linear networks and some nonlinear variants.

In particular, it is unclear what makes hypotheses spaces born from convolution and pooling operations so suitable for natural images. In this paper we study the ability of convolutional networks to model correlations among regions of their input. We theoretically analyze convolutional arithmetic circuits, and empirically validate our findings on other types of convolutional networks as well. Correlations are formalized through the notion of separation rank, which for a given partition of the input, measures how far a function is from being separable. We show that a polynomially sized deep network supports exponentially high separation ranks for certain input partitions, while being limited to polynomial separation ranks for others. The network's pooling geometry effectively determines which input partitions are favored, thus serves as a means for controlling the inductive bias. Contiguous pooling windows as commonly employed in practice favor interleaved partitions over coarse ones, orienting the inductive bias towards the statistics of natural images. Other pooling schemes lead to different preferences, and this allows tailoring the network to data that departs from the usual domain of natural imagery. In addition to analyzing deep networks, we show that shallow ones support only linear separation ranks, and by this gain insight into the benefit of functions brought forth by depth - they are able to efficiently model strong correlation under favored partitions of the input.","pdf":"/pdf/172845f5d68cc6e1b05bc593e048883d5df4e46c.pdf","TL;DR":"We study the ability of convolutional networks to model correlations among regions of their input, showing that this is controlled by shapes of pooling windows.","conflicts":["cs.huji.ac.il"],"keywords":["Theory","Deep learning"],"authors":["Nadav Cohen","Amnon Shashua"],"authorids":["cohennadav@cs.huji.ac.il","shashua@cs.huji.ac.il"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false},{"tddate":null,"replyto":null,"tcdate":1478202038100,"number":80,"tmdate":1478202038100,"id":"rJRhzzKxl","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/submission","forum":"rJRhzzKxl","signatures":["~Sebastian_Ruder1"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["~Sebastian_Ruder1"],"content":{"title":"Knowledge Adaptation: Teaching to Adapt","abstract":"Domain adaptation is crucial in many real-world applications where the distribution of the training data differs from the distribution of the test data.

Our goal is to initiate investigations that will be fruitful both for engineering better networks and also for eventually testing hypotheses on the neural mechanisms responsible for our own visual system's ability to perceive missing information.

Moreover, when these different models share the same deep architecture, the performance boost brought by the ensemble becomes even marginal. In this paper, we claim that the performance boost from the ensemble can be seen as benefit of increasing feature variance.

Biclustering has several noteworthy applications and has been successfully applied in life sciences and e-commerce for drug design and recommender systems, respectively.\n\nFABIA is one of the most successful biclustering methods and is used by companies like Bayer, Janssen, or Zalando. FABIA is a generative model that represents each bicluster by two sparse membership vectors: one for the samples and one for the features. However, FABIA is restricted to about 20 code units because of the high computational complexity of computing the posterior. Furthermore, code units are sometimes insufficiently decorrelated. Sample membership is difficult to determine because vectors do not have exact zero entries and can have both large positive and large negative values.\n\nWe propose to use the recently introduced unsupervised Deep Learning approach Rectified Factor Networks (RFNs) to overcome the drawbacks of existing biclustering methods. RFNs efficiently construct very sparse, non-linear, high-dimensional representations of the input via their posterior means. RFN learning is a generalized alternating minimization algorithm based on the posterior regularization method which enforces non-negative and normalized posterior means. Each code unit represents a bicluster, where samples for which the code unit is active belong to the bicluster and features that have activating weights to the code unit belong to the bicluster.\n\nOn 400 benchmark datasets with artificially implanted biclusters, RFN significantly outperformed 13 other biclustering competitors including FABIA. In biclustering experiments on three gene expression datasets with known clusters that were determined by separate measurements, RFN biclustering was two times significantly better than the other 13 methods and once on second place.

Under the deep learning framework, generalization performance highly depends on the learned latent representation which is obtained from an appropriate training scenario with a task-specific objective on a designed network model. In this work, we propose a novel latent space modeling method to learn better latent representation. We designed a neural network model based on the assumption that good base representation can be attained by maximizing the total correlation between the input, latent, and output variables. From the base model, we introduce a semantic noise modeling method which enables class-conditional perturbation on latent space to enhance the representational power of learned latent feature. During training, latent vector representation can be stochastically perturbed by a modeled class-conditional additive noise while maintaining its original semantic feature. It implicitly brings the effect of semantic augmentation on the latent space. The proposed model can be easily learned by back-propagation with common gradient-based optimization algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed method helps to achieve performance benefits against various previous approaches. We also provide the empirical analyses for the proposed class-conditional perturbation process including t-SNE visualization.","pdf":"/pdf/b2464af1f8faead224a3f69c2dfb8f48b4e90be3.pdf","TL;DR":"A novel latent space modeling method to learn better representation","conflicts":["lunit.io","kaist.ac.kr","samsung.com","nyu.edu","umontreal.ca"],"authors":["Hyo-Eun Kim","Sangheum Hwang","Kyunghyun Cho"],"keywords":["Deep learning","Supervised Learning"],"authorids":["hekim@lunit.io","shwang@lunit.io","kyunghyun.cho@nyu.edu"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false},{"tddate":null,"replyto":null,"tcdate":1478086272308,"number":43,"tmdate":1478086272308,"id":"ByOK0rwlx","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/submission","forum":"ByOK0rwlx","signatures":["~Mitsuru_Ambai1"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["~Mitsuru_Ambai1"],"content":{"TL;DR":"","title":"Ternary Weight Decomposition and Binary Activation Encoding for Fast and Compact Neural Network","abstract":"This paper aims to reduce test-time computational load of a deep neural network. Unlike previous methods which factorize a weight matrix into multiple real-valued matrices, our method factorizes both weights and activations into integer and noninteger components. In our method, the real-valued weight matrix is approximated by a multiplication of a ternary matrix and a real-valued co-efficient matrix. Since the ternary matrix consists of three integer values, {-1, 0, +1}, it only consumes 2 bits per element. At test-time, an activation vector that passed from a previous layer is also transformed into a weighted sum of binary vectors, {-1, +1}, which enables fast feed-forward propagation based on simple logical operations: AND, XOR, and bit count. This makes it easier to deploy a deep network on low-power CPUs or to design specialized hardware.\nIn our experiments, we tested our method on three different networks: a CNN for handwritten digits, VGG-16 model for ImageNet classification, and VGG-Face for large-scale face recognition. In particular, when we applied our method to three fully connected layers in the VGG-16, 15x acceleration and memory compression up to 5.2% were achieved with only a 1.43% increase in the top-5 error.

Most current single image SR methods use empirical risk minimisation, often with a pixel-wise mean squared error (MSE) loss.\nHowever, the outputs from such methods tend to be blurry, over-smoothed and generally appear implausible. A more desirable approach would employ Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference, preferring solutions that always have a high probability under the image prior, and thus appear more plausible. Direct MAP estimation for SR is non-trivial, as it requires us to build a model for the image prior from samples. Here we introduce new methods for \\emph{amortised MAP inference} whereby we calculate the MAP estimate directly using a convolutional neural network. We first introduce a novel neural network architecture that performs a projection to the affine subspace of valid SR solutions ensuring that the high resolution output of the network is always consistent with the low resolution input. We show that, using this architecture, the amortised MAP inference problem reduces to minimising the cross-entropy between two distributions, similar to training generative models. We propose three methods to solve this optimisation problem: (1) Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) (2) denoiser-guided SR which backpropagates gradient-estimates from denoising to train the network, and (3) a baseline method using a maximum-likelihood-trained image prior.

In this work, we first formulate dropout as a tractable approximation of some latent variable model, leading to a clean view of parameter sharing and enabling further theoretical analysis. Then, we introduce (approximate) expectation-linear dropout neural networks, whose inference gap we are able to formally characterize. Algorithmically, we show that our proposed measure of the inference gap can be used to regularize the standard dropout training objective, resulting in an explicit control of the gap. Our method is as simple and efficient as standard dropout. We further prove the upper bounds on the loss in accuracy due to expectation-linearization, describe classes of input distributions that expectation-linearize easily.

In this paper we introduce a new form of regularization that guides the learning problem in a way that reduces over-fitting without sacrificing the capacity of the model. The mistakes that models make in early stages of training carry information about the learning problem. By adjusting the labels of the current epoch of training through a weighted average of the real labels, and an exponential average of the past soft-targets we achieved a regularization scheme as powerful as Dropout without necessarily reducing the capacity of the model, and simplified the complexity of the learning problem.
